## 🏆 Problem Statement

In today's digital world, communication plays a crucial role in personal and professional life. Existing messaging apps often lack customization, real-time features, and easy accessibility across different devices. Additionally, users require secure authentication, multimedia sharing, and real-time engagement.

### 🔍 Challenges in Existing Solutions
- Lack of **real-time interactivity** in many chat applications.
- **Limited multimedia support** (text-only or basic file sharing).
- **Poor authentication mechanisms**, making apps prone to security risks.
- **Limited user control** over messages (editing, forwarding, deleting, replying).
- **Inefficient state management**, leading to performance issues.

### 🚀 Proposed Solution
Chatty is designed to address these limitations by providing a **fully interactive** chat experience with real-time updates, secure authentication via **Firebase**, media sharing, and customizable themes.
